-sporting opportunities for children, and making money available to encourage links between schools and sports clubs.Tony Cunningham: I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. To put this subject in context, something like 20 per cent. of school leavers in this country continue their sport with a sports club; in France, that figure is something like 70 per cent. I am therefore delighted about the investment. Will she talk to colleagues in other Departments&#151;the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Home Office and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;so that we can have a co-ordinated approach to this matter?

  I congratulate my hon. Friend on the work that he is doing to encourage not just sports in schools, but young people to carry on their sporting activity beyond school. I assure him that in this area of policy, as in many others, we work extremely closely not just with colleagues in DCMS but with colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Home Office.
