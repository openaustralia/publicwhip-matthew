  It is a genuine pleasure to respond to what has been an excellent debate. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), who has been a consistent advocate of more funding and more support for orphans and vulnerable children. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for City of York (Hugh Bayley) and for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), whose chairmanship of two all-party groups added considerably to the debate that preceded the preparation and presentation to the House of our strategy, entitled "Taking Action".
