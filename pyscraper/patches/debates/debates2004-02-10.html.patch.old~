- No devolution issues of that nature have been raised. In relation to non-devolution issues, I am sure that my hon. Friend will be well aware of the long-standing convention in relation to Law Officers' advice that has been adhered to by successive Governments. I remind him that the purpose of that convention is to enable the Government to get the legal advice that they need to perform their functions without having to explain or to justify it, or to reveal that they may have concerns about a particular legal position.Mr. Dalyell: Will my hon. and learned Friend show her QC curiosity in relation to the inquiries that the Scottish Secretary is to make into the payment to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine general command on 23 December 1988?
