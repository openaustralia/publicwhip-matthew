- A &#163;60 million capital investment programme to expand renal services began four years ago. There are now at least 700 extra dialysis stations and 28 more dialysis units, which will make it easier for renal patients to take holidays and travel on business.Mr. Pike: I know that tremendous advances have been made in Preston and Burnley in the north-west, but does my hon. Friend accept that the scheme needs to be improved so that people can arrange to go away in the knowledge that they can get a dialysis slot wherever they go? They should not have to be confined to taking holidays in this country. In this day and age, should we not be doing something to enable people to have dialysis abroad?
