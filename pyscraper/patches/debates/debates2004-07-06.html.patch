- A &#163;60 million capital investment programme to expand renal services began four years ago. There are now at least 700 extra dialysis stations and 28 more dialysis units, which will make it easier for renal patients to take holidays and travel on business.Mr. Pike: I know that tremendous advances have been made in Preston and Burnley in the north-west, but does my hon. Friend accept that the scheme needs to be improved so that people can arrange to go away in the knowledge that they can get a dialysis slot wherever they go? They should not have to be confined to taking holidays in this country. In this day and age, should we not be doing something to enable people to have dialysis abroad?

  Maximum waiting times for hospital treatment in my hon. Friend's constituency have halved since 1997. On 24 June, the Government set out our plans to reduce further waiting times for treatment, which will bring further benefits to my hon. Friend's constituents.

  May I celebrate my right hon. Friend's answer and the fact that he, rather than the Conservative party, is running the health service in London? There is still some spare capacity at Edgware hospital. Will he work with Barnet and Chase Farm trust and others to find out whether that extra capacity can be brought into use by some of the consultants there, who seem a little reluctant to travel the short distance involved?

  Increasing patient choice offers all patients, including those in rural areas, the opportunity to have more control over their health care. Choice should also lead to better quality services as health care providers respond to the choices that patients make.
