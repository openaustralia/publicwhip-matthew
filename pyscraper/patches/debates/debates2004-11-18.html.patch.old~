 <a name="stpa_14">My proposal for a delay until July 2007 would indeed be a compromise between the Lords&#039; proposal for 1 December 2007 and the House&#039;s earlier proposal for 31 July 2006. Hon. Members will know that my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley) has tabled an amendment to reinstate the 31 July 2006 commencement date, which gives my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick) an opportunity to vote in the way in which he has suggested. I do not feel passionately about the choice between the two dates, but it is important for us to demonstrate&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North did when he agreed to 2006 on the last occasion&#151;that this House is being reasonable, as well as insisting on the Bill being in the form for which this House has voted on a number of occasions.

  Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important that the person should be an independent figure? Does he also agree that the one thing that scarred the progress of the Bill was the very stiff programme motion introduced on Report, which meant that we were not able to discuss a large portion of the Bill at that important stage?
