  The Ministry of Defence maintains an extremely close working relationship with the Department of Trade and Industry on wind energy issues. Both Departments are members of the wind energy, defence and civil aviation interests working group, which also includes representatives from the Civil Aviation Authority, the National Air Traffic Service and the British Wind Energy Association. We also work jointly with the industry on round 2 offshore wind farm developments. Later this week, the Minister for Energy, E-Commerce and Postal Services and I will meet representatives of the wind energy industry.
