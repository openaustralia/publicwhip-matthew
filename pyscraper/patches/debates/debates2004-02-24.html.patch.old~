  Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend. The NHS plan, which we published some years ago, promised new and improved premises. Since its publication, six new GP premises in the Tameside and Glossop area have been replaced or refurbished. The local primary care trust there intends to develop extended primary care services in three locations across Tameside and Glossop with a total capital value of approximately &#163;15 million. It is currently considering the different methods of doing that, including NHS LIFT. My hon. Friend, like many people, has benefited from the &#163;1.5 billion that we are investing through LIFT schemes to refurbish or replace GPs' or family doctors' premises throughout England.

 normal three-month implementation period for National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance to nine months when photodynamic therapy to those suffering from wet age-related macular degeneration was involved. The Royal National Institute for the Blind estimates that, as a result, a further 2,800 people will go blind unnecessarily. Given that the institute also confirms that at least 50 centres across the country could provide extra photodynamic treatment from today, will the Secretary of State now scrap the July 2004 target for implementing this treatment and allow the NHS to deliver this important sight-saving service as a matter of urgency? If this is purely an issue of cost, I would remind him that the cost of blindness far exceeds the cost of treatment.

  On the latter point, we are well aware of the costs of blindness, pain and death, which is why we are investing so much in the national health service and doing it over such a sustained period. With regard to the hon. Gentleman's specific points, the timelines and flexibility that we sought on implementing the NICE guidelines were in full accord with the recommendations and advice from NICE. On implementation, it is not cost that prevents it&#151;more money than ever before is going into the treatment of a range of eye diseases&#151;but lack of trained personnel. We have made huge advances in that area, but the truth is that we cannot just conjure up trained personnel without forward planning and investment for their provision&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) interrupts me from a sedentary position, but no Government who bring in 80,000 additional cataract operations, as we are doing, can be accused of not taking eye conditions seriously. I assure him that we take this matter seriously, and that as soon as we can get the trained personnel, we will expand the provision. That is a continuing process and it will not be achieved overnight, but development and expansion of the NHS will continue in this area, as in every other area, over the next five years.

  I am well aware of the work being carried out by the committee in my hon. Friend's constituency. I know that it has taken a particular interest, for example, in mental health services. The overview and scrutiny committees have real powers to require information from the NHS and to require attendance by senior officers at their meetings. What is important is that we make sure that the type of activity that is going on in his constituency is replicated elsewhere. That is why I announced recently something like &#163;2.5 million for the Centre for Public Scrutiny, so that it can look at bringing together local councillors on the committees to examine how the activities that his committee may be undertaking can be used as examples elsewhere. In some areas, they have not been as strong as perhaps they are in his area. We are therefore looking at how we can spread that power to make sure that all are able to take advantage of the new powers given to them.
