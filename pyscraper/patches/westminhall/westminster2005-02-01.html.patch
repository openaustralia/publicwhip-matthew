-<p><a name="50201h01_spnew25"><b> Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury  </b> (Mr. Nick Ainger): First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) on securing an important and interesting debate. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said, due to the constituency that I represent, I am well versed with the message and the information. Although I do not want to get into a competition with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I might have almost as many dairy cattle in my constituency as he has in his. South-west Dyfed, as the area used to be called, or south-west Wales is one of the major dairy areas of Europe. I do not think that I can cover every issue raised in debate. I will concentrate on the dairy sector and TB while trying to respond to a few points made in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s opening speech.
