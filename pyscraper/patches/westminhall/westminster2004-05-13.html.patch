 : I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing us this opportunity to debate the important issue of poverty in south Asia. When one thinks of Asia, one thinks of a continent remarkable for its history. Ghandi, Nehru, Jinnah and Mother Theresa are four great people who shaped not only Asian politics, but world events. One thinks too of the continent's remarkable and diverse cultures and its stunning beauty&#151;for example, Nepal and northern India. One thinks not only of the great sporting talents that have emerged from Asia&#151;Muttiah Muralitharan and Sachin Tendulkar are two current examples&#151;but, above all, of people who are industrious, hard-working and ambitious on behalf of their nations.

 : As I was saying, our strategy in Pakistan is to support the Government's poverty reduction strategy and provide support for basic education and basic health care. One aspect of our work programme is to provide support for the Government's plans to recruit some 100,000 lady health workers nationally to step up the quality of, and increase access to, health care for 100 million people in Pakistan.
