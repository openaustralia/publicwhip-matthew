  Tax credits claims received by the Inland Revenue before midnight on Monday 7 July, the first full working day after the deadline, were treated as meeting the deadline for tax credits to be backdated to 6 April 2003, if appropriate. This was because the deadline fell at the weekend and to ensure that claims made through different channels were treated alike. Claims received after 7 July may be backdated for up to three months.

  In common with other regions, Northern Ireland has seen a decline in inward manufacturing investment as a result of the depressed global economic situation. Despite this, I am very pleased that in recent months major investment projects have been announced by Seagate and NACCO among others. Furthermore, Northern Ireland continues to be a particularly attractive investment location for service-based industry, as exemplified by the Abbey National's recent decision to open a new customer outreach centre at its Mays Meadow site in Belfast.

  At 31 July 2003, there were a total of 6,593 empty properties of all tenures of which 2,181 are Northern Ireland Housing Executive properties and 4,412 are in the private sector. Over half the empty homes in the public sector are undergoing redevelopment or are awaiting demolition. The Northern Ireland House Condition Survey 2001 published in April 2003 shows that the level of vacancies is linked to inner-city decline factors and the emergence of new apartment developments.
