  None. The redeployment of rolling stock was agreed by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to cover a potential shortfall in rolling stock elsewhere on the network. The rolling stock formations now in use on the c2c route are expected to accommodate demand. The SRA and c2c continue to monitor the impact of the changes on crowding levels on the route.

 Under this measure the estimated average congestion delay on motorways in England was 3.8 seconds lost per vehicle kilometre in 2000. Congestion in large urban areas in England was estimated as 24.8 seconds lost per vehicle kilometre in 2000 and 24.9 seconds lost per vehicle kilometre in 2002. These are the latest figures currently available. Estimates have not been made for years prior to 2000.

  Both blanket bog and lowland raised bog are priority habitats under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The Action Plans are published and are posted on the UKBAP website: www.ukbap.org.uk. Statutory site designation plays an important part in the conservation of both these types of bog. Notification as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) or Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs) in Northern Ireland, provides protection for over 400 peat bogs, with many of the most important areas managed by statutory conservation agencies through agreements with site owners. Where appropriate, the designation process can include compulsory purchase of the land. The UK has proposed 106 active and degraded raised bogs as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs) under the Habitats Directive, and 107 blanket bog sites as cSACs. In addition to this site designation, the UK is also encouraging the development of non-peat alternatives as growing media and promoting the use of alternatives. Our aim is for a minimum of 40&nbsp;per cent. of total market requirements to be peat free by 2005 and 90&nbsp;per cent. by 2010.
