  Applications to connect wind farm projects to the grid are treated in exactly the same way as any other form of electricity generation. Wind farm developers make applications to connect to either their local distribution network operator or to the transmission network operator and offers are made dependent on sufficient capacity being available on the grid.

  The Crime Reduction Delivery Board has been tasked with undertaking a speedy review of action needed to tackle crime committed with knives. Legislative restrictions on knives and other pointed instruments forms part of that work. This will include the effectiveness of Section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 which creates an offence of possessing an article with blade or point in public without good reason or lawful authority, with the exception of a folding pocket-knife with a blade not exceeding three inches.

  Yes. Although we have used the working title of a National Rape Helpline, evidence from the scoping study suggests very strongly that the helpline will need to cater for a wider group of core service users, including adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse.
