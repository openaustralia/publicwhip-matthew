 <a name="40324w04.html_para4">Last year, the Department for Trade and Industry published a White Paper on consumer credit that looked at credit card debt in the UK, suggested ways of tackling unmanageable levels of debt and offered advice to consumers looking for credit. The Government are working with the credit industry to ensure responsible lending and increase access to free debt advice. I am also aware that the Bank of England publishes monthly statistics on credit card debt.
