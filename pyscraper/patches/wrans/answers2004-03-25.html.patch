 <i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;March 2004]</i>: 25 clauses of the bill were formally debated during Committee Stage. Debates over fourteen sessions were both wide-ranging and detailed. Debate on the fees provisions lasted for seven committee sessions, and ensured a very full exploration of the Government's policy on tuition fees. A similarly long debate on the Government's proposal to establish an Office for Fair Access lasted for three Committee sessions. 25 clauses and seven schedules were not debated. Among the clauses not debated are 10 clauses that cover technical, interpretative or commencement provisions. The wide-ranging discussion on several clauses meant that the debates touched on a number of issues associated with later clauses that were not formally reached.
