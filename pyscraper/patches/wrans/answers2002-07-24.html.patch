  Taking account of the constituency interests and other policy responsibilities of Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), and in order to ensure that the advice set out in the "Guidance on Propriety Issues in the Handling of Planning Casework" is followed, I have decided that any planning matters arising in respect of the Dome and related developments should be dealt with by Christopher Leslie MP (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State).
