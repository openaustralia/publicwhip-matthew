  CAFCASS does not consistently collect statistics in relation to non-attendance or cancelled appointments at Child Contact Centres. The National Association of Child Contact Centres takes responsibility for the collection of national statistics, so as to develop a national perspective. It is not a mandatory requirement at the present time that NACCC member contact centres keep such statistics.

  There is an expectation that private law reports are completed within 10 to 12 weeks of the request date to CAFCASS. Teams that are unable to meet this requirement generally make arrangements with their courts to extend the timetable for preparing reports.
