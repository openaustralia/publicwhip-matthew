<p>See how Tony Blair's government has changed from day to day, month to
month, reshuffled to reshuffle by clicking on the buttons at the bottom
of the Java applet.  

<p>The colours are zoned by government department, and the distance from
the centre signifies seniority, with the cabinet occupying the inner
layer.

<p><b>Instructions:</b> Position the web page so that the entire animation 
fits on your screen.  There are two rows of grey buttons at 
the bottom.  Use these to change the date of display.  For example, 
to see who is in Tony Blair's government today, click on the 
button on the right hand side marked "Today".

<p>When the names are not in motion, you can also click on one of them
to see which department they belong to.  Click on the same name a second time 
to see that person's ministerial career.

<p><span class="ptitle">Not working?</span>  You may need to wait 
a minute for it to load.  If you are able, download <a href="http://www.java.com">Sun's
Java software</a>.  On Windows, the old unsupported Microsoft versions
of Java will not do.</p>

<h2><a name="details">Background</a></h2>

<p>This applet-animation is a visualization of the XML file <a
href="/data/ministers.xml">ministers.xml</a>, which the Publicwhip
central computer updates every twelve hours by scanning the
Parliamentary webpage
<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hciolists/hmg.cfm">Her
Majesty's Government</a> for changes.  We have kept all versions of
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/publicwhip/publicwhip/rawdata/chggpages/govposts/">
this page</a> back to June 2004, which is about when we first thought of
this idea.  Earlier information was kindly sent to us by the House of
Commons library in several emails.  The source code for this little
program is in the
<a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/publicwhip/publicwhip/">SourceForge
CVS</a> under custom/radialtree, and is protected by the General Public
License.  

<p>If you have any easy to implement suggestions for improvements while the
code is still fresh in our minds, please email the team.  We've already
thought about using pictures instead of names, but they don't fit on the
page and are much more unrecognizable than names.
