<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Lots of people use Public Whip to understand what parliament is doing,
and to research their area of special interest.  We'd like to share this
workload, so you get other peoples research and clarifications, and 
contribute your own.  It's also much less lonely this way!

<p>There are lots of ways of doing this, here are some tools we provide
so far.  <a href="mailto:team@publicwhip.org.uk">Email us</a> if you have 
questions and comments, or <a href="/forum">chat in the forum</a>.

<h2>Motion Text Editing</h2>

<p>Above the motion text for every parliamentary division, we currently
make the following statement:

   <blockquote>"Procedural text extracted from the debate, so you can try to work
   out what 'aye' (for the motion) and 'no' (against the motion)
   meant. This is for guidance only, irrelevant text may be shown,
   crucial text may be missing."</blockquote>

<p>While <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a> helps
make debates more friendly, it doesn't make the motions more readable, and we
still often guess it wrong. Not only that, even when we get it right, the
accurate text uses too much Parliamentary jargon and refers to other documents
by citing page and line numbers (for example).

<p>Public Whip allows anyone to write a plain english version of the
motion, with links to explanations and relevant document.  Julian has taken on
the task of doing <a href="/dreammp.php?id=210">all the Iraq votes</a> and the 
<a href="/dreammp.php?id=258">counter-terrorism legislation</a>.  Have a
look at them as examples.

<p>We are calling for anyone who is passionate about other issues in
Parliament that have been subject to frequent, repeated votes by MPs.
It could be immigration, education, the environment, transport, ID
cards, international development, and so on.  Find the divisions, mark
them with a Dream MP, and fix the motion text so that other people can
see the precise measures that were voted upon.  Public Whip is about
informed choice, and not having to take anyone's word for things.

<h2>Commenting on Debates</h2>

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>
you can add comments to parliamentary debates.    This is a good way to add
information you have found out about the discussion where anyone can find it.
