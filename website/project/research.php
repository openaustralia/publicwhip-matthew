<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Lots of people use Public Whip to understand what parliament is doing,
and to research their area of special interest.  We'd like to share this
workload, so you get other peoples research and clarifications, and 
contribute your own.  It's also much less lonely this way!

<p>There are lots of ways of doing this, here are some tools we provide
so far.  <a href="mailto:team@publicwhip.org.uk">Email us</a> if you have 
questions and comments, or <a href="/forum">chat in the forum</a>.

<h2>Motion Text Editing</h2>

<p>Above the motion text for every parliamentary division, we currently
make the following statement:

   <blockquote>"Procedural text extracted from the debate, so you can try to work
   out what 'aye' (for the motion) and 'no' (against the motion)
   meant. This is for guidance only, irrelevant text may be shown,
   crucial text may be missing."</blockquote>

<p>While <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a> helps
make debates more friendly, it doesn't make the motions more readable, and we
still often guess it wrong. Not only that, even when we get it right, the
accurate text uses too much Parliamentary jargon and refers to other documents
by citing page and line numbers (for example).

<p>Public Whip allows anyone to write a plain english version of the
motion, with links to explanations and relevant document.  Julian has taken on
the task of doing <a href="/dreammp.php?id=210">all the Iraq votes</a> and the 
<a href="/dreammp.php?id=258">counter-terrorism legislation</a>.  Have a
look at them as examples.

<p>We are calling for anyone who is passionate about other issues in
Parliament that have been subject to frequent, repeated votes by MPs.
It could be immigration, education, the environment, transport, ID
cards, international development, and so on.  Find the divisions, mark
them with a Dream MP, and fix the motion text so that other people can
see the precise measures that were voted upon.  Public Whip is about
informed choice, and not having to take anyone's word for things.

<h2>Commenting on Debates</h2>

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>
you can add comments to parliamentary debates.    This is a good way to add
information you have found out about the discussion where anyone can find it.

<h2>Guidelines for editing the text of motions</h2>

<ul>

<li>Avoid Parliamentary jargon.  Phrases like "Question Put", "I beg to move",
and "Third Reading" should not be used unless explained.  

<li>Make it clear which side won the vote so people don't need to read the
numbers to discover the result.  When they do look at the vote chart after
reading the motion text, they should already know what the Ayes and Noes mean.  

<li>Whenever there is an amendment to a motion, both the original motion and
the amended motion should be listed, never the amendment which is meaningless
on its own.  

<li>Include all possible hyper-links.  Parliamentary motions can mention
Departmental Reports, Command Papers, UN resolutions, items in the news, and
past statements or votes in the House.  Track everything down using Google and
make links to them so that people who don't know these source documents exist
can find them.   Political statements must at no time be more than one click
away from the facts that support or dispute it.  

<li>If there is a vote to pass a Statutory Instrument, link to the Statutory
Instrument and the Statute.  Votes to change the Parliamentary Standing Orders
should link to both versions of the Standing Order and provide an explanation
and examples.  However, not every mention of a Standing Order needs to be
linked if it's the Speaker reading them out to justify what going to happen
next.  

<li>A division on a piece of legislation must have the full and correct name of
the Bill in the title followed by a dash "--" and any further qualifiers:
"Money Resolution", "Second Reading", "Programme Motion", etc.  

<li>The reason for these qualifiers in a legislation division is to put the
vote in its place within the standard procedural plot.  Links to the next unit
(eg the Standing Committee page) and the preceding unit of the plot is also
desirable.  

<li>You must endeavor to link to the correct version of the Bill.  There can be
several and you must carefully examine the titles and the dates to be sure to
get them right.  The links to them are often broken, but the pages can be found
by searching for the title in quotes plus site:parliament.uk in Google.  

<li>When a clause or set of clauses are agreed to, link to them directly and
summarize their meaning if possible.  Interpret the meaning as best you can,
and if you can't fully understand it, say so.  If a clause amends another Act
that is online, then link directly to that part of the Act that has been
changed.  In the future we will be able to create back-links.  The word
"clause" and "section" are sometimes used interchangeably.  

<li>Amendments to clauses are the hardest part of the job.  You have to read
the top and the bottom of the debate relating to the division very carefully.
When the Speaker says: "With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following Amendments" he's telling you the subject of the debate, not the
meaning of the division.  The division only applies to what the MP said in the
phrase: "I beg to move".  However, some of the amendments the speaker lists may
need to be considered because the amendment that was moved is incomplete on its
own.  This is because each contiguous change in the text is a separate
amendment.  It's sometimes possible to find a webpage listing all the
amendments.  

<li>Watch out for the phrase "Amendment by leave withdrawn" just before the
division is called, or you will put in the wrong text.  Sometimes the Speaker
restates the amendment before or after the division, but many times not.  Watch
out for negations: "That the original words of the clause stand part" versus
"That the amendment be made."  

<li>Once you have started working through the votes on a Bill, stick to it.  It
can take as long as an hour to piece together the meaning of a division in the
worst case.  Fortunately, they don't vote on the most boring parts of the Bill,
so you don't need to analyze them.  However, it's a good idea to page through
the full text of a Bill to get a feel for its content.  Once you get to know it
a little bit you'll be best placed to finish it off, so do so.  

<li>As well as making the motion text as clear, readable and honest as possible
so that people can decide how they feel about the MPs who voted for or against
it, leave it in a state that gives those who want to do further research a head
start.  If you spent an hour working out a motion, think of it as saving an
hour of someone else's time, which means they will be able to do research that
would otherwise not have been possible.  For example, newspaper reporters need
to get to creditable facts quickly.  You may have given them a channel into the
heart of the process which means they don't have to rely on a self-serving
Government press notice to track down the news.  

<li>Motion text editors are independent of Parliament, which means we can be
critical of its process in the way that anyone in the system is unwilling or
unable to be.  But check up on each other's work whenever you can, and discuss
it in the forum.  

<li>We have experienced little use and no actual signs of abuse.  Until we
experience abuse, we cannot make provisions for it.  In practice, wikis
experience surprisingly little abuse, probably because it's usually obvious and
there are more people prepared to erase the abuse than create it.  There's
always the chance that a party may try to hijack this outlet as they do so many
political happening.  However it's unlikely because it could too easily be
found out and backfire.  

<li>To prevent us (Francis and Julian) from abusing PublicWhip, we have
released all the code under the General Public License.  We would also like to
establish a public repository for all the DreamMP and Motion Text information
so that we can't be accused of owning the information.  The safeguard is that
anyone with the right skills can download and establish a rival version of
PublicWhip (under another domain name) in case we get lazy, sell out, or run
into some sort of legal hassle.  We must ensure that it can live on by
disabling our ability to abolish it.  

</ul>
