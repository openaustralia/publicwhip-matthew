<h1>Back in the real world (for now)</h1>

<p><img src="../thepublicwhip.gif"></p>

<p>Counting votes on your behalf, <b>for free for ever</b>
<br/>(even if we have to go to the Cayman islands)</p>
<p><b>Media enquiries</b>, ring Francis Irving of Public Whip on 07970 543358.

<h1>OK, not just yet...</h1>

<p>Of course, we're never going to charge you to use The Public Whip.
It would kind of defeat the point.  We're offended that you thought
otherwise.  At the moment, the site is extremely cheap to run. But
that could change.

<p>Last night the EU Council of Ministers <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/07/ec_says_yes_patents/">adopted
legislation</a> which would make our costs a lots higher.  They did so despite
opposition from several countries, and the elected European Parliament.  And they
had to break their own procedure to adopt it. The new law is not
only bad law, but the way it is being passed is <a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/OpenLtr050307En">anti-democratic</a>.

<p>Please  
<a href="http://www.aleph1.co.uk/talks/swpatstalk.html">read this excellent
talk</a> to find out why we disagree with the new law.  But here's
a quick summary:

<ul>
<li>The new law allows somebody else to own intellectual property that we made.  
<li>It makes it costly for us to even find out that somebody else owns it.
That's the &pound;N000 charge mentioned on the previous page; we'd have to shell
out for an initial basic search by a patent lawyer.
<li>The "intellectual property" concerned isn't even very clever.  It's about
as complex as how to lock a front door, or make a piece of toast.
</ul>

<h1>What we'd like you to do</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.writetothem.com">Write to all your MEPs</a> and tell them
to vote against the directive when it comes back to the European Parliament for
second reading.  If you're not sure what to put, 
<a href="http://comment.zdnet.co.uk/other/0,39020682,39190515,00.htm">
this ZDNet leader</a> will give you some inspiration.
<li>That's all. We're not feeling demanding today.
</ul>

<h1>Can I just look up how my MP voted?</h1>

<p>Yes, <a href="/">you so can too</a>.  But you have written to your MEP first,
haven't you?
