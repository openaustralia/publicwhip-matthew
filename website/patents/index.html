<p><b>What is this all about software patents?</b>  
<i>Imagine that someone owned a patent giving them the exlusive right to know
How to make a piece of toast, or how to lock a front door. Everytime you did
one of these simple actions, you risk being sued and forced to pay huge damages
for patent violation.</i>

<p><i>Imagine that someone owned a patent giving them the exlusive right to know
how to make a piece of toast, or how to lock a front door. Everytime you did
one of these simple actions, you risk being sued and forced to pay huge damages
for patent violation.

In the world of software developers, this absurd situation is about to
become a reality.</i>

<p><b>The Public Whip is threatened by a proposed EU software patents
directive</b>.  Many software patents are passed even though the "inventions"
are obvious to anyone who can program, and even when there is prior art.  The
EU directive will stifle innovation in software and destroy businesses.
Organisations will no longer own the software that they write.  Instead
some corporations will collect trivial patents and charge for them, while doing no
useful work.

<p><b>The Public Whip depends on our freedom to write software</b>
