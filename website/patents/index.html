<h1>Please pay &pound;N000</h1>

<p>We regret that because of changes in EU law, we now have to charge
for use of The Public Whip.  We need <b>initial funds</b> of &pound;N000 to 
comply with this new law.  Unfortunately we have <b>no idea</b> how much we will
ultimately have to charge.  Maybe we'll have a better idea after you give us the N
grand.  

<p>You're just going to have to send us <b>loads of cash</b> now.  We can't promise we'll
ever have The Public Whip going again. But if we do, you can be sure we'll have
had to charge you <b>oodles of spondoolicks</b> more.
