<p>Public Whip is an independent project to help the public watch MPs.
If you would like to contact someone about a particular issue or problem
concerning you, instead try the following:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com">Fax Your MP</a> to contact your
own MP.

<li>
There are <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hciolists/alms.cfm">
email addresses</a> for MPs who make them available.

<li>
<a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk">Number 10</a> is a good place to
start if you would like to take an issue up with central government.

</ul>

<p>
You can also contact us  with errors, questions, ideas, interviews, talks,
and offers of grants,  but only about the Public Whip project itself.  We're just a few
people who run a website, and <b>not part of the government</b>.  Please email
<a
