The Election
------------

Over the Election, our traffic doubled, with many people
looking at detailed voting records on specific issues for
Cambridge, Manchester Withington and Bristol West - all
university area seats that unexpectedly swung from Labour.

In April + May (to 10th) Public Whip has had 55,000 unique
visitors looking at 0.9 million pages. In April + May (to
18th) TheyWorkForYou has had 160,000 unique visitors looking
at 1.2 million pages.

Here are the issues you were most interested in:
    iraq
    gay rights
    top-up fees
    foundation hospitals

The MPs you were most interested in were
    Anne Campbell, Cambridge
    George Galloway
    Tony Blair, Sedgefield
    Valerie Davey, Bristol West
    Karen Buck, Regent Park & Kensington N
    Keith Bradley, Manchester Withington

Where each vote made the most difference, in Cambridge,
Manchester Withington and Bristol West, the electorate were
actively looking for their own factual information. With
sites such as Public Whip and TheyWorkForYou.com

informing the electorate how their sitting MP voted, it
becomes much easier to confirm a voting record, possibly
distorted in election leaflets.

Of those people Oona King lost her seat in a high profile,
vicious contest with George Galloway, Diane Abbot is an MP
who used PublicWhip to show her real voting record rather
than the record fabricated by her opponents. Of the top 16
MPs visited, all were either party leaders, or involved in
very strong challenges for their seats. Where the election
was most actively locally (rather than nationally), voters
looked harder at the voting record of their sitting MP.


Changes to publicwhip.org.uk
----------------------------

We recently recorded our 1,000,000th vote by an MP in our
database. We've improved your ability to show comparisons
MPs and your Dream MPs On each Dream MP page there is a
postcode lookup box, which compares that Constituency's MP
to a Dream MP. You can copy the HTML and put it on your own
pages highlighting your own issues.

        http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/dreammp.php?id=230

"3-line whip" has been added for Dream MPs. The phrase comes from
weekly whipping sheet from party whips to your MPs. It has an
agenda for the next week , and they underline divisions
the MP is expected to attend. They triple underline
divisions that *must* be attended. You can now do this for
your own Dream MP, highlighting the important divisions and
giving them more weight when MPs are compared.

RSS feed of interesting divisions. This feed is really
useful to keep track of what is happening in parliament.
For more on RSS, see the FAQ http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/faq/

The wiki for motion text now lets you also change division
titles, giving an easily understandable summary of what is
being voted on. e.g
        http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2005-02-07&number=70

Because a picture equals a thousand words, we now
have graphics of MP distances from Dream MP on the
Dream MP pages. You can visually see how an MP compares to
what you'd ideally like.

Reading information in
----------------------

PublicWhip and its sister project, TheyWorkForYou.com have
had a shared Parliamentary Parser. This is the software
which watches and reads the Parliament website, and updates
our databases with the latest changes. We've now made it a
separate project, so it is much clearer what software does
what, and how it feeds into both PW and TWFY
http://ukparse.kforge.net

We've updated the FAQ to have more answers about who we are, and
   * What's your connection with TheyWorkForYou.com?
   * Are you happy to give interviews about Public Whip?
   * Do you make any money out of Public Whip?
   * Have you had any problems what you are doing?
