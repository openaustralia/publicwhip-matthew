<p>Have a look at the more recent <a href="archive.php">newsletter archives</a> as
well.

<h2>Votes back to 1997 - 4 October 2003 by Francis</h2>
<p>You can now browse and examine most of the 1997-2001 parliament.
There are still a few divisions missing because of errors in Hansard.
Also the motion text extraction algorithm is particularly bad on this
older data, so don't expect too much of it.  There's lots of fun new
stuff to look at. For example, old warhorses and figures from recent
history now appear in the twilight of their parliamentary career.  Take
a look at <a
href="/mp.php?firstname=Paddy&lastname=Ashdown&constituency=Yeovil">Paddy
Ashdown</a>, <a
href="/mp.php?firstname=John&lastname=Major&constituency=Huntingdon">John
Major</a> or <a
href="/mp.php?firstname=Tony&lastname=Benn&constituency=Chesterfield">Tony
Benn</a>.
</p>

<p>Go have a dig for information.  Perhaps you would like to know just
how many divisions have been <a
href="/search.php?query=hunting&button=Search">spent trying to ban fox
hunting</a> over the last six years (make sure you take off divisions
that only mention it in passing in their motion text).  Or if you
prefer, go hunting yourself for all the <a
href="/search.php?query=terrorism&button=Search">divisions on
terrorism</a> which occurred <i>before</i> September 11th.  Let us know
if you find anything interesting.

<p>Amongst this new data is a first case of mass abstention.
In a <a href="/division.php?date=2000-12-13&number=2">curious vote about EC fishing
regulations</a>, 77 members from the Conservative party voted both aye
and no.  Does anyone know the story of what they were trying to signal?  Why
is this the only occasion in 6 years when so many have used double
voting to mean something?</p>

<h2>New logo and look - 2 October 2003 by Francis</h2>
<p>Giles has been working away, and given us a new logo and look.  Thank
you Giles!  This involves a few changes, and I might have broken
something.  If anything doesn't work, then send us an email.</p>

<h2>MP votes twice in one division - 25 September 2003 by Francis</h2>

<p>When I first analysed the database of votes which the Public Whip
software generated, I was a bit shocked.  There are dozens of occasions
when an MP voted both aye and no in the same division. How could
this be?  Fortunately, it is perfectly allowed.  Have a look at the new
page about <a href="/boths.php">double voting</a> for a list of occasions
when it has happened.  And for an explanation.</p>

<p>Before today, MPs who voted twice were listed twice everywhere.  This
meant that one of their votes counted them as a rebel!  They no longer
are, so the number of rebellions is slightly reduced for some MPs and
divisions.  On the other hand, the counts printed in Hansard "The House
divided: Ayes 199, Noes 393" include double votes, so they differ even
more from Public Whip's counts which list double voters separately.

<h2>Turncoats and byelections - 18 September 2003 by Francis</h2>
<p>Politics, being human, is endlessly rich in the variety of things that it throws 
up.  This may be good fun, but it's bad when you try and encode things
in a rigid computer database.  The quirk in this case is <a
href="/mp.php?firstname=Paul&lastname=Marsden&constituency=Shrewsbury+%26+Atcham">Paul
Marsden</a>, member for Shrewsbury & Atcham, who changed party from Labour to the
Liberal Democrats about the time of the Afghanistan war.</p>

<p>For a while now Public Whip has coped with this by treating him as
two MPs, one who left the house on 10th December 2001, and another of a
different party who joined the house the next day.  The same format is
also used to store MPs who've died, resigned, won a new seat created
during the Parliament, been expelled, or who have been certified as
insane.   Really!  Check out the complete list of 
<a href="http://www.election.demon.co.uk/causes.html">causes of byelections</a> since 1832.

<p>A few people have queried Paul Marsden's position as top rebel
in the list on the <a href="/index.php">front page</a>.  Has the site
accidentally counted his votes as a Liberal Democrat as rebellions
against the Labour whip?  The answer is no.  His entry there is
calculated using only divisions while he took the Labour whip.  There is
another entry for him as a Liberal Democrat further down the rebels
table.  Today I've changed the site to clarify this a bit by saying
"whilst Lab".  Hopefully that will lead people to realise it takes into
account that he has changed party.  It seems unsurprising that somebody
who changed party had a high rebellion rate in their old party just
before the change.

<p>Today's a good day to be thinking about this as it's the Brent East
byelection.  As I write the result hasn't been announced yet.  I look
forward to entering the new MP into the database in time for their first
division...

<h2>Detecting abstentions - 16 September 2003 by Francis</h2>
<p>Quite often members deliberately refrain from voting in a division,
even if they are in the house so could have done so.  Conversely, on an
important vote, the whip of one party will deliberately try and get a
higher turnout.  A while ago Becka suggested a way of detecting these
effects.</p>

<p>You add up the turnouts for each party across <b>all</b> divisions
and end up with a percentage expected vote share per party.  Then you
calculate, given the total turnout for this particular division, what
the percentage would lead you to expect.  If the number of voters in
the party is much different from your expectation, then something
interesting is happening.</p>

<p>This calculation has been in Public Whip for a while, manifest as a
mysterious column of numbers on the party table in the division listing.
I've hopefully made it a bit clearer, using the terminology of
abstentions, and displaying high abstention parties even if nobody in them
voted.  Have a look at the recent <a
href="/division.php?date=2003-09-10&number=307">Iraq and the UN vote</a>,
where the Lib Dems proposed a motion.  You can see from the large
abstention number for the Conservatives that the party whip must have
been to abstain.  Indeed none of them voted at all.</p>

<h2>Which Gareth Thomas? - 12 September 2003 by Francis</h2>
<p>One of the things I'm doing at the moment is improving the quality of
data for the current parliament.  There are sometimes omissions or
inconsistencies within Hansard itself.  Those errors for recent months
are corrected when the session is put into a "bound volume".  Although
this concept originally applied to the paper versions of Hansard, it is
passed on to the electronic version.  There are also sometimes errors in
the bound volume text as well.</p>

<p>One example is <a
href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/cm030120/debtext/30120-25.htm">division 56</a> from
during a debate on occupational pensions at the start of this year.
There are two MPs both called Gareth Thomas, one the member for Clwyd
West and the other for Harrow West.  In this division Hansard doesn't
say which one it was that voted.
I asked the <a
href="http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hcio.cfm">House of Commons
Information Office</a>, who seem to regularly get strange queries like
this.  After some time researching the answer, someone in this
not-quite-byzantine bureaucracy kindly emailed me on Wednesday to say
that the voting member was the one for Harrow West.  You can now
<a href="/division.php?date=2003-01-20&number=56&showall=yes">see the
division</a> on this site.</p>

<p>This all sounds a bit trivial and tedious, if necessary as every
MP's reputation could be at stake.  But there are worse things
to come.  The scariest is that quite often the count of votes does
not equal the count listed in Hansard "The House divided: Ayes 100, Noes
200.", when there are actually perhaps 101 ayes listed.  This
happens often enough that I haven't quite dare mention it to HCIO
yet.</p>

<h2>Summer's ended - 9 September 2003 by Francis</h2>
<p>Parliament has reconvened now summer is over.  However, under this new
system, after only two weeks it will adjourn for the party conferences. 
Yesterday there were <a href="/search.php?query=water+bill&button=Search">three divisions
votes</a> on the Water Bill.  I'm doing these updates semi-manually at
the moment, so new divisions will only be available a few days after
they happen.</p>
