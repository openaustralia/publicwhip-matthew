Subject: Public Whip Extra #6 - Religious hatred votes in full
Date: Wed, 01 Feb 2006 10:42:19 +0000

Yesterday the Government lost votes in Parliament for the 3rd and 4th times
since coming to power*.  The Commons retained amendments the Lords had made to
the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill. Here are the divisions in full:

The end of the debate is unusual - with investigation of delays in the aye
lobby, and a statement by Charles Clarke on the Government's position following
their defeat.

If you want to know more than is in the news stories, reading the rest of the
debate is probably the easiest and most entertaining way to learn what the
amendments mean.

* There were actually two divisions last time the Government was defeated in
the Commons. They were on a related subject to each other, so it might be
reasonable to describe them as "one defeat" as the BBC has done, but it isn't
entirely so.
