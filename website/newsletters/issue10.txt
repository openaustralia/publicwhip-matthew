Welcome to the seventh Public Whip newsletter.

Inside this issue:


data-mine the record of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, so
that you can hold them to account.

Editorial - 

Recently, due to a combination of accident and laziness, all our new 
work went up onto the main website instead of the staging area.  

This ruined our plans of having a proper launch party in an expensive room 
in the Palace of Westminster with free drinks, canape's, small-talk 
and all that useful networking when we put online the table of Lords' votes 
for the public to see for the first time.  

Oh well.  We couldn't have afforded it anyway.  I guess that's 
because we haven't got any adverts.  


***********************************************************************
House of Lords

Yes, it's up there.  All the votes in the second chamber back to the 
general election of May 2005, interleaved with the votes in the Commons.  
There's a drop-down box in the banner of the 'division' page should you 
wish to see the votes of only one chamber at a time.  Everything is 
seamlessly integrated(tm) across all features.  That means we track 
the record right across the boundary when an MP gets elevated 
into the upper chamber

Some brave people have even filled in the Policy votes across the two houses, 
so the whipping doesn't stop just because the member has changed seat:

We'll push the data back in time as far as it goes once we finish 
correcting all the typos.

Division information

The division page has grown an extra column, the 'majority' on each vote.  
But that's not all.  Now you can break the voting down per party in 
each House.  Simply select the Parliamentary term, the house, and the party, 
and see the numbers that are ordinary hidden behind other numbers.  

We put this in because we noticed that the Conservative party often 
had suspiciously low turn-outs in their votes, and wondered whether 
there was such a thing as whipping for an abstention.  See the 
bottom of the table at:

Those looking for clues what the actress said should look no further than:

***********************************************************************
The forum

As always, the forum is open to all who come.  Parts of it are most 
log-in-able.  The FAQ has been lightly overhauled, and we're ready 
to embark on another round of tweaks when we work our what we're 
doing.  We'll continue as before, unless the Legislative Reform 
Act renders all this work pointless.  In the meantime, enjoy it 
while you can.
