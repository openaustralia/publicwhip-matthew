Welcome to the fourth Public Whip newsletter.

Inside this issue:
* Editorial

* Project Spotlight: "Labour's Rebellious Tail"
* Using Public Whip: "Media Attention"

The Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk ) is a project to data-mine the
record of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, so that you can hold them
to account.

Editorial

Spring is rapidly passing into summer, and I can now work in the park if the
sun doesn't shine too brightly on my laptop screen.  We've been busy the last
few months preparing a whole new section on the Public Whip website, and
helping some others on an interesting secret project.  More news soon.

Unfortunately, Public Whip's existence is being threatened by a new European
directive on software patents.  The Public Whip website is currently suspended,
to show you what the world would be like if this directive is passed.  Please
help us by contacting your MP or the DTI by Monday.  Full details here.

Despite this, enjoy the rest of the newsletter.

Comma Separated Values - Site Updates 

Some of you have already found our "raw data" page.  Here you can find the
voting record and other information about your MP in data files.  These can be
loaded into your spreadsheet or other software for further analysis.  Some are
in CSV (Comma Separated Value) files, others in XML (Extensible Markup
Language).

Over the last few months we've added lots of new raw data. This includes files
of rebellion rates and of links to external sites about individual MPs.  If
there is any special data you need, just ask.  Let us know if you do anything
interesting, and we'll plug it in this newsletter.

We've upgraded the site with a brand new parser backend.  There aren't any
large benefits yet, but you can look forward to them over the next two months.
Meanwhile here are a few small improvements.  For example, the titles of
divisions are slightly clearer, always including the name of any relevant bill.

There is now a handy link "read the full debate" which takes you to the start
of the debate in Hansard.  This is in addition to the link which takes you to
the division listing in Hansard.

After the Higher Education Bill in January, lots of people asked us for a list
of those who did not vote at all in a division.  This is now available for
all divisions.

Labour's Rebellious Tail - Project Spotlight

Heard about the curious Tory split in voting patterns during the 1997
parliament?  Or Labour's rebellious "tail" in this one?  Chris Lightfoot has
done some more maths on the MP voting records, and made lots of pretty
pictures.  And drawn some at least entertaining conclusions.

Chris went on to investigate which MP has politically moved the most between
the last parliament and this one.

Media Attention - Using Public Whip

Meanwhile, some of you have been using information from Public Whip to get
attention in the media.  Here's an analysis in a local newspaper of how Sussex
MPs voted in the last parliamentary session.
http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/local_info/mps/mpvoting.html

Unfortunately, all data can be misrepresented.  This article by a local
political party describes how Michael Howard has a low voting record in
parliament, and says that is a bad thing.  At Public Whip we want more MPs to
vote, but we want them to think about the issue first - better not to vote at
all than just make it up.  And we also recognise that the Leader of the
Opposition has better things to do.  Low attendance can be a good or a bad
thing, it's just a clue about what is going on, not an absolute performance
metric.

The Sunday Times has an interesting article on how the Internet is going to
change politics forever, and gives examples of websites such as The Public
Whip.

The New Statesman have nominated us for their New Media Awards 2004.  Have a
look at the full list of nominees here, and leave a kind comment next to The
Public Whip.
