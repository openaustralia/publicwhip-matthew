Welcome to the sixth Public Whip newsletter.

Inside this issue:
* Editorial - Glory Glory!
* Be Glorious with Public Whip
* Cool new political sites
* Stuff people have been doing with Public Whip
* Stuff we're doing to Public Whip

The Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk ) is a project to
data-mine the record of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, so
that you can hold them to account.

Editorial - Glory Glory!

Vanity, thy name is Public Whip. This month we're still glowing from a
recent and richly undeserved flurry of awards and interest. We'd like
to thank our agents...

First, and not least, The New Statesman New Media Award for Civic Renewal:

http://w3.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/regional/story.asp?StoryID=58368

And second, we made it onto a list of BBC news online reader's
favorite political sites:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3530938.stm

There are some real gems on there, so it's well worth a browse.

Now, lest this make us sound big-headed, we're aware of how much there
is left to be done, especially in documenting all the features on the
site. However, we need your input to know what to prioritise, so
please let us know if you are stuck trying to use or adapt anything.

Anyway, now onto the real meat:

Be Glorious with Public Whip

So, you wanna piece of the action, eh? You wanna stand up, be counted,
and put down some lines of quality code for the good of democracy?
Well, we'd be glad to have you on board, whether as a tester, coder or
designer. In fact, there are plenty of new ways of getting involved
with Public Whip, and here are just a few new examples this month:

TheyWorkForYou.com, Public Whip's sister site, has opened up it's wiki
to interested helpers:

Hot, delicicious Euro voting data is sitting there just waiting to be
processed. "$name, $name" it sings siren-like, "come and write some
code to tell the world about my secrets":

Meanwhile in Canada, Public Whip is already being converted. Want to
lend a hand in the World's Best Place to Live(TM)?

Finally, mySociety is hosting an event for potential volunteers for
Public Whip, TheyWorkForYou.com and mySociety itself. The Public Whip
crew will be there, and mySociety is buying the drinks. See you there!

Cool new political sites

Neither of these are built by us, but we give them the highly
prestigious Public Whip Thumbs Up anyway:

Polidex - a stockmarket in MPs. Great fun, and perhaps with some help
from the Public Whip massive it could be even better:

A careful look at backbench revolts in Parliament, as and when they happen.

Stuff people have been doing with Public Whip

Chris 'GNUPlot' Lightfoot on the connection between the number of years 
MPs have been sitting in parliament and their voting patterns:

Malcolm Bruce MP is using a sydicated feed from TheyWorkForYou on his
website.  Now, we're not cheap or anything, but, go on, Vote Bruce!
Bruce for RSS!

Some Dream-MP like stuff going on in Europe. Worth a rummage:

Stuff we're doing to Public Whip

Ministers, they come and go like the autumn leaves, and nobody remembers
who the junior ones were five years later.  We've been compiling an
electronic, structured data file of all paid ministerial posts since
1997.  Of course, it automatically updates itself by carefully watching
the parliament website.  Take a look at the raw XML, and let us know if
it looks right or wrong.
