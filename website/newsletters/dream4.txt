Hello Dream MP,

Somehow we've managed to complete large amounts of hacking
on the website whilst everyone has been changing the data, 
and somehow it's not all gone belly-up in the process.  
This is unusual in our experience.

There are many new features which we don't need to announce
right now.  We do, however, need to announce that the way
you change a policy vote (formerly known as Dream MP)
has altered.

We've thrown away that useful side-bar chart of all the
policies you could vote for.  Now you need to go to the
page of the particular policy, then click on one of
the selected divisions, which then takes you to a page 
where you can change a vote (a little drop-down box 
above the motion text, if you are logged in).

To add a new vote rather than change one that is already there, 
you have to click the "Every division" link near the top of 
the page, then select which division (from the thousands) 
you want to make the policy vote in.

An example of such a page is

http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/policy.php?id=792&display=everyvote

We hope to improve this interface a little in due course.

In the meantime, feel free to make use of the Forum for
any gripes, praises, whatever.  It's useful if we can
all see the problems and queries being encountered.

Also, please, please, when you edit motion text, can you 
add in as many links as you can, particularly to the Bills 
and legislation that is being amended.  This should be 
easy to do if you are actually doing your homework properly.  

Francis and Julian
The Public Whip
