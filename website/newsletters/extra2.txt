If you're going to vote in the European elections on Thursday, you
might first want to quickly find out how your MEP has voted in the
European Parliament.  There are now lots of sites about to help you do
this.  Here are some that I've found.

Environmentalists can get a detailed summary of how their MEP has
voted on everything from nuclear power to genetically modified
organisms.  Great website from Friends of the Earth, complete with
smiley faces.

Are you concerned about oppressive patent legislation, as described in
the last Public Whip newsletter? This site will tell you not only how
your MEPs voted, but all the candidates replies when asked how they
will vote on the software patent issue.

The great daddy of them all, with complete voting records for the
whole parliament on every issue.  Poke about, and see how your MEPs
voted before you vote for them.

Enjoy the election,
