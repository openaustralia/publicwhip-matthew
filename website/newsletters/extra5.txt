Subject: Public Whip Extra #5 - Terror law voting record in full

As a special treat, we've put up today's divisions in parliament a day
earlier than usual. You can see the voting record of the government's
defeat.

And read the debate here.

This is made possible by "Today in the Commons", a new service from
Hansard. Thanks to the hard working clerks!

Note that all this is provisional. It's new that parliament does this
at all, and our code for processing it is also new. Hopefully soon
Public Whip will update automatically with new divisions shortly after
they happen.
