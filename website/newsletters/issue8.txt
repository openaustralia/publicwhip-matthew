Subject: Public Whip Newsletter #8 - For one day only, counting YOUR vote
Date: Mon, 02 May 2005 23:59:46 +0100

Welcome to the eighth Public Whip newsletter.

Inside this issue:
  * Information to help you decide how to vote

The Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk ) is a project to
data-mine the record of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, so
that you can hold them to account.

***********************************************************************

Hello voters,

Thursday is the only day in four years when Public Whip will be
watching how you vote, rather than how your MP voted.  It's a
bank holiday Monday, so soon I'll go out and doze in the sun
like I did yesterday.  But before I do, I'd like you to do one
thing.

* Forward this newsletter to all your friends.

We've got a quick guide on how to vote smartly using real
information, rather than media spin.  We'd like as many people as
possible to use it.

Francis
The Public Whip

P.S. The election is the beginning not the end.  Lots of things
are being brewed up for the next parliament.  Watch this space,
and be ready to help us out.

Information to help you decide how to vote

Q. First the basics.  What choice will I have in my constituency?

To find out go to the BBC election site.  Enter your postcode in
the FIND YOUR CONSTITUENCY box half way down on the right.
    http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/
Read the list of candidates, skim read the profile, and check out
the results last time.

Q. Did my ex-MP do a good job?  Do they deserve to be hired again?

A. Read TheyWorkForYou's full report card about your ex-MP (if
they are standing again).  Just enter your postcode to find out
everything from how they voted on fox hunting to whether they are
responsive to letters from constituents.
   http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/
Use your local knowledge as well, ask your friends, especially if
they've had any contact with your ex-MP.  You're their boss, how
do you rate their performance?

Q. Which party plans to do what I would do?

A. Take the How2vote quiz.  This venerable guide (it was around
at the last election!) asks you for your opinion on everything
from the environment to education.  It then compares the party
policies to yours.
    http://www.how2vote.co.uk/
Who is doing what is best for you, best for the UK, and best for
the world?

Q. Should I vote tactically, and if so how?

A. It may be that you are in a marginal seat, where your vote can
make more of a difference cast for a party that you don't
support.  Check out the "results last time" on the BBC page you
went to above.  If you strongly dislike one of the top two
parties or candidates last time, you may want to vote for the
other even if it isn't your favourite.

Various people have set up websites to encourage this sort of
behaviour.  Here are all the ones I could find - most let you
select your constituency, and tell you the local situation.
    If you want to vote against Tony Blair but for Labour
        http://www.backingblair.co.uk/
    If you want to vote against the Conservative party
        http://www.tacticalvoter.net
    If you want to vote against the Iraq war
        http://www.strategicvoter.org.uk/
    If you live in Dorset
        http://www.votedorset.net/

Public Whip and friends in the news

Meanwhile our election quiz is going down a storm since the last
newsletter.  Try it out if you haven't yet.

An interesting response in Northern Ireland (the quiz excludes
the constitutional question, so gives people unexpected results)

Britons get better election info than any election, ever, anywhere

Financial Times amusingly suggests we could rate MPs better if we
moved them to random constituencies after electing them...

And if you think election time is grim, at least you aren't an MPs wife.
