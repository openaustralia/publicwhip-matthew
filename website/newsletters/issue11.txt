Introduction - Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2007

The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2007 exempts Parliament
and MPs from the transparency law which lets you scrutinise public
bodies. The Bill had an unusual and colourful passage through the
House of Commons the week before last.

Below, we explain the clever tricks that the Government used to pass
the law with as few MPs as possible visibly responsible, and shows you
which MPs are REALLY to blame.

If you've missed the news the last week, here is a quick summary of the Bill

And here is the full history of the Bill on Parliament's funky new Bill pages.

P.S. If you want to stop the Bill, then the only way is via the House
of Lords.  Please go to http://www.writetothem.com/lords click "Random
Lord", and write them a letter to tell them how you feel about the
Bill.

Third Reading - 18 MPs who tried to hide that they supported the Bill, exposed

Because they have little Parliamentary time, it's particularly easy to
stop Private Members Bills by filibustering. That is, by "talking the
Bill out".  Many members tried to stop the FOI(A) Bill by
filibustering.

At the end of the day on 18th May there were two votes one right after
the other. 

The first was a closure motion which would stop the bill from being
talked out.  Anyone supporting the closure motion was supporting the
passage of the bill.  Closure motions are very unusual for private
members bills.

The second vote was the crucial Third Reading, which actually passed
the Bill.
    http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2007-05-18&number=123

Many news outlets have published lists of those who voted against
Parliamentary transparency in that final vote. For example.
    http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6670749.stm

Using Public Whip, you can also find those MPs who voted for the
closure motion, but then didn't vote in the final division. These MPs
are also responsible for passing the Bill, but were trying to evade
having it publicly recorded that they were doing so.

The following MPs voted for the closure motion, and then didn't vote
in the Third Reading. This means they supported the Bill (or else they
would have joined in the attempt to filibuster) but were not confident
enough of their opinions to put on record that they supported it in
the Third Reading division itself. Well, that or they had to rush home
in the vital 16 minutes to feed their dog.

Report Stage

There were three other divisions on FOI(A) a week ago on Friday. One
was a filibuster division.
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2007-05-18&number=119&dmp=996

And two were amendments that would have made the Bill do more exactly
what its stated purpose was (to protect constituents correspondence),
without exempting Parliament and MPs from all other FOI requests.
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2007-05-18&number=120&dmp=996
http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2007-05-18&number=121&dmp=996

You can use those to make more lists of MPs who really supported the
Bill.  But that gets a bit complicated, so instead here is a complete
list summarising every MPs overall voting record on the Bill.

http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/policy.php?id=996&display=comparison

Those near the top (such as Norman Baker, Richard Shepherd and David
Winnick) have a perfect record of opposing the Bill at every possible
point. Those at the bottom of the list (such as Tom Watson and John
Randall) have the imperfect record of having supported the Bill at
every possible point.

You can also find a quick summary on every MP's TheyWorkForYou page.
It is in the Voting Record section. For example, for my MP it says
"Very strongly for a transparent Parliament."

Second Reading - 646 MPs (all of them) unable to say the word "object!"

The Freedom of Information Amendment (Bill) 2007 is not officially a
Government bill, but a Private Members Bill sponsored by an ex-Tory
whip called David Maclean. However, everybody knows that really the
Government fully backs the Bill.

    http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6689031.stm

If you still claim that it is not a Government Bill (for example, if
you are David Boothroyd), then let's have a discussion about it here :)
    http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2911#2911

The curious thing about Private Members Bills is that they are
incredibly easy to slow down and stop. Of particular puzzlement is why
nobody objected to it at second reading. All that it would have
required would be for one MP to shout out "object". But nobody did.
    http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2007-01-19a.1115.1

If anybody can explain this, please let us know on the forum!

Meanwhile, it seems quite reasonable, if harsh!, to individually blame
every single MP for the passage of this Bill through the Commons.

Now it's your turn.

To stop the Bill now, the only way is via the House of Lords.

Please go to http://www.writetothem.com/lords click "Random Lord", and
write them a letter to tell them how you feel about the Bill.

You might like to point out some of the following that matter to you
  * That MPs voted against amending the Bill to only cover constituents
    correspondence.
  * That anyway, privacy of constituents correspondence is already
    covered by the Data Protection Act.
  * That really the Government is trying to weaken Freedom of
    Information legislation.
  * That this will further deteriorate the relationship between people
    and Parliament.
  * That secret Government is worse Government.
  * That the nefarious way the Government is passing this Bill is
    insulting and undemocratic.
