Editorial 

The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2007, which exempts Parliament and
MPs from the transparency law, passed through the House of Commons the week
before last after an unusual and colourful Parliamentary history.

This special Public Whip newsletter tells you a bit more about the clever
tricks that the Government used to pass the law with as few MPs as possible
visibly responsible, and shows you which MPs are REALLY to blame.

If you've missed the news the last week, here is a quick summary of the Bill

P.S. If you want to stop the Bill, then the only way is via the House of Lords.

them a letter to tell them how you feel about the Bill.

Filibustering the Third Reading

Because they have little Parliamentary time, it's particularly easy to stop
Private Members Bills by filibustering. That is, by "talking the Bill out".
Many members tried to stop the FOI(A) Bill by filibustering.

At the end of the day on 18th May there were two divisions one right after
the other. The first was a closure motion, the rejection of which was an
attempt to filibuster the Bill.

The second vote was the crucial Third Reading, which actually passed the Bill.

Now, many news outlets have published lists of the MPs who voted for the Bill,
and so against Parliamentary transparency, in that final Third Reading vote.
For example.
    http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6670749.stm

Using Public Whip, you can also find those MPs who voted for the closure
motion, but then didn't vote in the final division. These MPs are also
responsible for passing the Bill, but were trying to evade having it publicly
recorded that they were doing so.

The following MPs voted for the closure motion, and then didn't vote in
the Third Reading. This mean they supported the Bill (or else they would have
joined in at the attempt to filibuster it) but were not confident enough of
their opinions to put on record that they supported it in the Third Reading
division itself. Well, that or they had to rush home in the crucial minutes
to feed their dog.

If any of those are your MP, you may like to write them a letter.

ask on the forum and we'll give a little tutorial.

[ A bonus curiosity from that page - the following three members voted against
the filibuster just before Third Reading, and yet also voted against the Bill
at the Third Reading division itself. Maybe they opposed filibustering on
principle, and also opposed the Bill. A bafflingly moral stance: Philip
Hollobone, Kettering (Con).  John Maples, Stratford-on-Avon (Con). Dan Norris,
Wansdyke (Lab, PPS) ]

Second Reading - 646 members unable to say the word "object!"

The Freedom of Information Amendment (Bill) 2007 is not officially a Government
bill, but a Private Members Bill sponsored by an ex-Tory whip called David
Maclean. However, everybody knows that really the Government fully backs the
Bill.

If you still claim that it is not a Government Bill (for example, if you
are David Boothroyd), then let's have a discussion about it here :)
    http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2911#2911

The curious thing about Private Members Bills is that they are incredibly easy
to slow down and stop. Of particular puzzlement is why nobody objected to it at
second reading. All that it would have required would be for one MP to shout
out "object". But nobody did.

If anybody can explain this, please let us know on the forum!

Meanwhile, it seems quite reasonable, if harsh!, to individually blame every
single MP for the passage of this Bill through the Commons.

Now it's your turn.

If you want to stop the Bill now, then the only way is via the House of Lords.
Please go to http://www.writetothem.com/lords click "Random Lord", and write
them a letter to tell them how you feel about the Bill.

You might like to point out some of the following that matter to you
* That MPs voted against amending the Bill to only cover constituents correspondence.
* That anyway, privacy of constituents correspondence is already covered by the Data Protection Act.
* That really the Government is trying to weaken Freedom of Information legislation.
* That this will further deteriorate the relationship between people and Parliament.
* That secret Government is worse Government.
* That the nefarious way the Government is passing this Bill is insulting and undemocratic.
