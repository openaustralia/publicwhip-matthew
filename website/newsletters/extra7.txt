Subject: Public Whip Extra #7 - "Abolition of Parliament Bill"
Date: Sun, 02 Apr 2006 13:45:23 +0100

Shortly after Easter it is the third reading of the "Abolition
of Parliament Bill" (Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill).
This bill gives any minister the power to change the law by
order, without proper parliamentary deliberation and debate.

The Public Whip supports parliamentary scrutiny of legislation,
therefore we oppose this Bill. Moreover, we believe that the
major constitutional change which this Bill represents should
have a proper public debate, both in the media and in full on the
floor of the house.

-- Francis Irving, volunteer for The Public Whip team

P.S. If you haven't heard of this Bill before, don't be surprised. 
It has not had prominent enough coverage in the media. Please
tell your friends about it, in case they haven't heard of it
either.

P.P.S. Journalists, call me on 07970 543358 if you would like an
interview about this.
