Subject: Public Whip Extra #3 - Ministerial whirl
Date: Wed, 01 Dec 2004 18:54:53 +0000

We're proud to report that we have made an animated ministerial history
of Tony Blair's government.

Apart from creating an item of eye candy, we've also slotted this
information into both sets of voting tables.  It's in the per-MP table
For example, you can see Robin Cook stopping being Lord Privy Seal on
17th March 2003, just before the Iraq war vote.

And it's in the division tables as text saying "Minister" next to the
party of MPs who are part of the so-called payroll vote.  Members of the
government do not, as a rule, rebel from the party whip.  If you do see
an apparent rebellion on our lists from someone who is in government,
this either means it was actually a free vote, or our data is incorrect.

If the data is wrong, please send us a correction. If it's a free vote,
well... we'd love to report them all, but no one's been able to provide
us with the necessary information. The party whip, although totally
influential and obvious to all who are in the chamber, is not part of
the official public record.
