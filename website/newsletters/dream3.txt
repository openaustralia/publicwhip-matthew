Subject: Rebranding the Dream MPs

Hello Dream MP,

Thank you for all your votes in the Dream Parliament up till now.  
We've decided to make a little bit of a change to the situation, 
and this feature is evolving.

From now on, instead of the words "Dream MP" they will be called
"Policies".  The idea is that rather than listing your own
private opinion on a wide variety of issues across all of the
votes in Parliament, we create clusters of votes that support
a particular policy on a particular single issue.  Then, later,
you will be able to express your position by picking out these
policies, rather than construct it from the thousands of individual 
votes.

We're also learning from the success of Wikipedia by starting
to relax the need for a log-in.  Anyone should be able to invent
and describe a new policy and keep its votes up to date and
usefully consistent.  In the meantime, all your old Dream MPs, which
are now Policies have become "Private Policies".

If you find any problems, errors, or spelling mistakes, please
e-mail us at support@publicwhip.org.uk.  If you experience
any political disagreements with a vote by a policy, please
announce it on the Forum.  We like discussions and arguments
showing up there.  It shows someone cares.

Francis and Julian
The Public Whip
