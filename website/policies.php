<p>Policies are stated positions on a particular issue. For example "Privatise
the NHS", or "Join the Euro". Each policy has a definition and a way to
vote in relevant divisions in Parliament.

   <ul>
      <li><a href="account/addpolicy.php">Make a new policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="/forum/viewforum.php?f=1">Discuss policies on our forum

   <p>This table summarises all policies, including how many times they have
   "voted".  Click on their name to get a comparison of a policy to all MPs.
   <b>You can get a policy to the top by editing and
   correcting motion text for its divisions.</b> </p>
