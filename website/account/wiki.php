        The raw, and frequently
        wrong, motion text is there by default.  Feel free to remove it when
        you've replaced it with something better. </p>

        <p>Please, keep it accurate, authorative, brief, and as jargon-free as
        possible so that new readers who don't know Parliamentary procedure can
        gain enlightenment. You are encouraged to include hyperlinks to the
        statutory legislation, command papers, reports, and committee
        proceedings that are referred to so that readers who want to follow the
        story further will know where to look.</p>

        <p>You can write comments, but please keep them below the "COMMENTS AND
        NOTES" line so that they don't interfere with the provision of what we
        hope could be the most authoratitive and accessible record of what's
        going on in Parliament.</p>
