        every division.  Your MP can represent anything you like.  For example:
        <ul>
        <li>Organisation.  e.g. Greenpeace, Confederation of British Industry.
        <li>Single issue campaign.  e.g. Pro-Hunting, Anti-Europe, Anti-Iraq war.
        <li>Political party.  e.g. Labour party whip.
        <li>Prospective parliamentary candidate.  e.g. Tory candidate for Sedgefield.
        <li>Your self.  Issues that you personally care about.
        </ul>
        <p>All dream MPs are public.  It is important that you do not
        misrepresent an organisation.  Do not make it appear that your MP is an
        official representation of, say, Amnesty International's views, unless you have
        the authority from Amnesty International to do so.  Instead put
        \"Unofficial Amnesty International\".
        <p>Your name and email address will be displayed alongside your made-up MP, masked
        to prevent spam.  If you represent an organisation, register with The
        Public Whip using an email address of that organisation.  Dream MPs which
        appear to represent an organisation but do not really will be removed.
