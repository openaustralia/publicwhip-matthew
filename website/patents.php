<p><b>The Public Whip is threatened by a proposed EU software patents
directive</b>.  Many software patents are passed even though the "inventions"
are obvious to anyone in the industry and there is prior art.  The EU directive
will stifle innovation in software and destroy businesses.  Organisations will
no longer own the software that they write, instead the corporations who
collect trivial patents will.

<p><b>On 17-18 May, the Irish Presidency is attempting to push through the
software patents directive at a meeting of ministers.</b>  The European
Parliament has voted for a version of the directive which is much better.
The Council of Ministers is due to overrule the democratic decision of the
Parliament, and pass the much worse original form of the directive.

<p><b>Please act now to save The Public Whip and other cool software:</b>

<p>
<ul>
<li>If you are in parliament, contact ***minister** and them to
change Britain's vote in the Council of Ministers to be against the
counter-proposal.
<li>If you are a voter, <a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com">Fax Your MP</a> (free!) and tell your MP to write to ***minister*** and ask him to change our vote.
<li>Media queries, please ring ***phonenumber*** of ***organisation***
<li>Comments, or more information please <a href="mailto:support@publicwhip.org.uk">email us</a>.
</ul>

<p><b>The Public Whip depends on our freedom to write software</b>
