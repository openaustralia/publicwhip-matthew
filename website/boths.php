<p>Amazingly, on <? print $count; ?> occasions in these parliaments,
an MP has voted twice in the same division.  It's a little known fact that this is perfectly
allowable, provided one vote is aye and the other is no.  For details see under the
heading "abstention" in the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/p09.pdf">division factsheet</a> from the House of Commons Information Office.  

<p>An MP may have done this to cancel the effect of a mistaken vote in
the wrong lobby.   However, it would seem reasonable to encourage the
practice as a signal of active abstention from the vote.  You can see in
the table below one clear case of this happening, where many Conservative
members abstain on a fishing issue.

<p>This table lists all instances of double voting.  You can select the column
headings to sort it by MP name or by division date.
