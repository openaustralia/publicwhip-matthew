<?php search_example($db, true) ?>
<p class="search"><span class="ptitle">MPs:</span> You can enter a postcode
to get a list of all MPs for that constituency, or else enter their name or
part of their name.  If you don't know exactly how to spell the name,
write it as best you can like it sounds.

<p class="search"><span class="ptitle">Divisions:</span> 
To find divisions you are interested in, enter the
name of a subject, such as "Pensions" or "Hunting".  The Public Whip
will search the titles of the divisions and the text of the motion being
debated.  If you enter multiple words, it will only find entries where they 
appear next to each other as you enter them.  You can enter part of a word.

<p class="search"><span class="ptitle">Written Answers:</span> 
To find Written Answers, enter the name of a subject, such as "China" or "Fair
Trade".  You can enter multiple words separated by a space, and the Public Whip
will match answers which contains all the words.  Enter exact whole words, so
try "weapons" as well as "weapon".
