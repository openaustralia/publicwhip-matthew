<p>This table shows how members of each parliamentary party voted on each issue
in parliament between 2001 and 2005.  These are averages for each party.  So,
Labour comes out as only "agree" on many issues, rather than "agree
(strong)", because many members rebelled on these controversial issues.
Follow the link for each issue to find out more about which votes we used
to do this calculation.  The links in your ex-MP's column (if they are standing
again) will take you to a detailed breakdown of how they voted on the issue.
</p>
<p>The last row shows how each party compares to you.  The difference between
you and the party on each each is summed up and averaged.  100% means you 
exactly agree with how the party voted, 0% means you exactly disagree.
Each issue is given equal weight, although if you were neutral on an issue
it will naturally score less.  The party which we suggest you vote for (above)
has the largest value in this bottom row.

Your friend ${_POST['yourname']} <${_POST['youremail']}> saw this
'how to vote' website and thought of you.

http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/election.php

The site asks your opinion on key issues (such as the Iraq war,
Hunting and Foundation Hospitals).  Then it compares your opinion
with the actual vote in parliament of MPs over the last four
years, and recommends which party you should vote for.

Unlike the parties, we don't have any marketing budget, so
please help us out by forwarding this to any of your friends
who might like it.  We believe that both MPs and parties should
be held to account for how they voted in parliament.

Enjoy the election!

The Public Whip ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk ) is a project to
data-mine the voting record of Members of the United Kingdom
Parliament, so that you can hold them to account.
