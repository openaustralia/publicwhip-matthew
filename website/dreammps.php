<p>Politicians as you want them to be.  A Dream MP can represent anything
you like.  For example:
    <ul>
    <li>Organisation.  e.g. Greenpeace, Confederation of British Industry.
    <li>Single issue campaign.  e.g. Pro-Hunting, Anti-Europe, Anti-Iraq war.
    <li>Political party.  e.g. Labour party whip.
    <li>Prospective parliamentary candidate.  e.g. Tory candidate for Sedgefield.
    <li>Your self.  Issues that you personally care about.
    </ul>
