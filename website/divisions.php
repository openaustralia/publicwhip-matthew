<p>A <i>division</i> is the House of Commons terminology for what would
normally be called a vote.  The word <i>vote</i> is reserved for the
individual choice of each MP within a division.  Divisions with a high
number of suspected rebellions are marked in red.  Sometimes these are
just divisions where the whips allowed free voting.  You can change
the order of the table by selecting the headings.
