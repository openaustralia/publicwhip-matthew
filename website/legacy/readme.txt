This is used for migration of early wrans gids on Public Whip to those
finally used on TheyWorkForYou.com

The wrans.php file uses wransmap.txt to do a redirect.  The other two
files sphinx-wrans.txt and baked-wrans.txt are the raw data I used to
make wransmap.txt -- they give a map from gid to House of Commons
question number, on each of the two servers (sphinx for Public Whip,
baked for TheyWorkForYou).  The script "build" does the conversion.
