Selected divisions table needs clear right

Divisions titles are getting truncated as well
phpbb.topic_title is too small a table

Link from users names everywhere to their forum page

Make it clearer can discuss individual Policy votes on forum

Make policy vote selection 
    - thing formatted differently
    - have drop down, show most recent 3 at top

No link back to division here

Usability
---------

Change links to say "compare to" in them. Link should always say what it links
to, not vary according something random about the page currently on.

On this one, the two tellers for the noes have been lost
date=2003-03-14&number=114

check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Run these without patches, and an entire title is unceremoniously ditched:
answers2001-07-05.xml
answers2001-07-10.xml

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates
The correct division has an explicit-division-end, which doesn't need to be erased.
So some unspoken text is being lost.

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Find for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Future
------
