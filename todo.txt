Wrans
-----

League table of how many didn't questions 

Index text in titles
Check stemming

Entities - sort out set_entity_encoding on sphinx, and which encoding web pages are in
	(make sure simon and lembit have accents ok)
Decide whether you should just use numbers for entities

Some kind of "most inquisitive" on front page

Be consistent about where "show all contents" link is - above or below table.

Print department
Match office (secretary of state...) to department?  Julian does this already
prob, check how it works and use it in all the tables, as it is useful at-a-glance
information.

uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.755W.4 - refers to uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-03.214W
which does actually exist, but crosses over two entire columns, so referencing the one in the middle doesn't pick it up.  Ooops.  Need some kind of ranging?
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.726W.0 - there is a phrase referring to debates, but the
link is given to wrans ;)
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-06.725W.2 - has a offrep which isn't there (as well
as two which we don't have indexed yet)
uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-27.110W.2 - fails to find offrep

Back links to wrans that have referred to this one
Check all found URL links

Improve all MP name matching so no unknown ids
Make "unknown" name link a better page (rather than a meaningless error)

Make tables have alternating rows

Stats - count up how many questions/answers each person has done

Simple comments / vote system?

Search for all questions that are about Hansard that you can now answer,
and send off the answers.
Put party/constuency in speakername?
Separate out date of asking and date of answering

Give help on how to request answers from hcinfo

Web site
--------

Popular pages today are...  Grep the logs somehow clever.

Postcode search redirect automatically to MP page

Letter index on MP list

Pass W3C validator
http://validator.w3.org/
And bobby

Find max teller people

Abstain -> difference from expected
Expected -> average no. of attendees
visually draw guesses further right

FAQ needs to give more of an impression that we would like help

Scraper
-------

House of Lords

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Make clustering cope with tellaye/tellno
Make cluster stuff store NUMBER OF VOTES both voted in for extra possible friends info

Look at majorities

Make one script I have to run which just does everything (backup logs,
get latest divisions, upload to db)

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Search for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Improve motion text / title extraction
    division.php?date=2003-02-03&number=74 - and div 73, detail missing
    division.php?date=2003-09-16&number=313 - too much text [interruption]
    division.php?date=2001-11-26&number=85 - excess interruption
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
    division.php?date=2003-09-10&number=307 - motion missed completely
    division.php?date=2001-01-22&number=71 - title is wrong!
    division.php?date=1997-07-07&number=42 - nothing of any use!
    division.php?date=2000-02-28&number=88 - too much text!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=321 - not deferred division!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=320 - not deferred division!
Add explanations
    division.php?date=2001-10-25&number=43 - multiple motions clearer,
also show initial motion in second vote, rather than hardly any text
