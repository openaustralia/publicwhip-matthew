party summary table, or in first line on division page (the Aye-voters). (FD)

Make newsletter signing more streamlined

to, not vary according something random about the page currently on.

check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Run these without patches, and an entire title is unceremoniously ditched:
answers2001-07-05.xml
answers2001-07-10.xml

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates

So some unspoken text is being lost.
