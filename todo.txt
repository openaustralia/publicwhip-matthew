Just use usernames 

Link to Hansard should be to TWFY on Interesting Divisions table

General
-------

Show which pages are looked at a lot, and encourage poeple to look at least popular.

Make links underlined, the ones in the middle of the text anyway (rather than navigation)

Make it clearer before you sign up that your email domain is public when
you make a Dream MP.

Interesting Divisions link doesn't go to interesting divisions - and people would like to

Do a big usability thing - get Tom L to help with his ideas
Make log file stats daily to see what happens as you subtly change links
Controversial: Remove cluster map, Remove division attendance

Update the votematrix CSV files - people are using them!
Put up raw data for ranking scores for rebel/attend that are only in fawkes

General Election
    Write letter to new MPs to tell them about the Public Whip

Change frontpage newsletter advert depending on whether you are logged in

Web page URL of you

Comments (PHP/MySQL website style) on 
    - individual votes
    - dream MP page

"If the MPs rarely decisively vote on anything meaningful, we should not
apologize for it.  The deam MP exercise gets your optimistic
participation, and then you uncover the full horror that out of all this
apparent activity, there's fu*ck all happening.  It's only for show.
It's a disgrace."
- we need a discussion page for this, so people can work it out

"We can rate MPs on the basis of what they successfully get out through
written questions, because this is like science.  You don't become a respected
scientist or journalist by passing exams or getting the right jobs.  You do it
by advancing human knowledge, finding key facts out that are real interesting.
Then you get taken seriously.  Before then you're just a student."

Make authority clearer - link to email domain web page?

Party comparison
Put dream MP ranking on MP page

Check what Julian thinks of score sorting etc.

Web site
--------

Make newsletter signing more streamlined?

On konqueror on division page the "What is Tell?" etc. bar overlaps the Rebel
voters table in some cases. (On divisions with few voters / parties)

Popular pages today are...  Grep the logs somehow clever.

Tour somehow for first time users

FAQ needs to give more of an impression that we would like help

Link to ideas.txt file

Backup dynamic database on cron job (newsletter does this OK for now)

Voting accuracy

On this one, the two tellers for the noes have been lost
date=2003-03-14&number=114

check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Run these without patches, and an entire title is unceremoniously ditched:
answers2001-07-05.xml
answers2001-07-10.xml

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates
The correct division has an explicit-division-end, which doesn't need to be erased.
So some unspoken text is being lost.

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Search for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Improve motion text / title extraction
    division.php?date=2002-02-06&number=158 - incomplete
    division.php?date=1997-07-07&number=42 - nothing of any use!
    division.php?date=2000-02-28&number=88 - too much text!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=321 - not deferred division!
    division.php?date=2003-09-17&number=320 - not deferred division!
