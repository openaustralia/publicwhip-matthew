Add clock time so sorting is right

Check Rebellions/Attendance are over the correct time period that they say they are
http://staging.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2005-03-21&number=2&mpn=Lord_Wedderburn_of_Charlton&mpc=Lords has crap title

Oops! - check state of division comparison stuff, and put in cron
properly

On front page "Recent Controversial Divisions" has columns without headings

Drop down boxes at the top

Make it clearer can discuss individual Policy votes on forum

Search on forum page bizarrely goes to forum search box (no /?)

Backup database on seagrass

Usability
---------

Policy / MP comparison box should let you enter name of MP
or constituency as well as postcode

Electech tour for first time users

Remove terms and conditions tickbox from registration

Rethink "Join us" section of site
- Email with random unedited motion text

Make newsletter signing more streamlined

Link more clearly to simple list of aye/no voters - perhaps from word "aye" in
party summary table, or in first line on division page (the Aye-voters). (FD)

Finish rename of motion text editing (e.g. in project/ pages)

Make policy vote selection have drop down, show most recent 3 at top

Show divisions with the same beginning part of title in sidebar

Policy status - done vs. provisional

Policies need reversed name - so can be described negatively and positively
    - perhaps have box with sentence for/against

Calculate interesting divisions for MP pages using
    - rebellion
    - turnout
    - government majority
    - is teller

Stuff
-----

Rebellions and attendance by time range rather than mp id (needed for Lords)

User page on forum - link to all of a user's policies?

Write code to fill in pw_cache_realreal_distance (after model of dreamreal_distance)
Migrate away from mpdist table to pw_cache_realreal_distance
Also do pw_cache_divisiondivision_distance 

Remove division_id from database
remove mps_query_start

Rewrite description of formula

Do a big usability thing - get Tom L to help with his ideas
Make log file stats daily to see what happens as you subtly change links

Backup dynamic database on cron job 

Show comments actually on the policy page / divisions page?
Indicate better that discussion can go on?

Voting accuracy
---------------

When counts mismatch between list of names and Hansard's totals,
automatically put suspicion text in motion text.

On this one, the two tellers for the noes have been lost
date=2003-03-14&number=114

check this line not lost: <a name="30513w02.html_dpthd1"><H3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS<xref locref=140></H3>

Run these without patches, and an entire title is unceremoniously ditched:
answers2001-07-05.xml
answers2001-07-10.xml

Check this one:
./lazyrunall.py parse --date=2003-12-18 --force-parse debates
The correct division has an explicit-division-end, which doesn't need to be erased.
So some unspoken text is being lost.

Resolve all the errors that "scraper.pl check" squirts out

Check for divisions which don't have quorum of 40

Measure abstentions by parliament rather than global proportions?

Check "Question accordingly..." fits with our counting
Tally vote numbers in text and check they fit with our counting

Find for divisions on days MP joined/left, as these could have
off-by-one errors for their changed party

Future
------

Policy aggregation function - generic version of election.php

Search needs to search division text and policy text and forum

Preview on motion editing form, and policy editing

Show if and how many times each person spoke in debate leading up to division,
and link to their speeches (FD)
