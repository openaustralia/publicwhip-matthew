# AWSTATS CONFIGURE FILE 5.5
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.mydomain.conf and edit this new config file
# to setup AWStats (See documentation in docs/ directory).
# The config file must be in /etc/awstats, /etc/opt/awstats or /etc (for
# Unix/Linux) or same directory than awstats.pl (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux...)
# To include an environment variable in any parameter (AWStats will replace
# it with its value when reading it), follow the example:
# Parameter="__ENVNAME__"
# Note that environment variable AWSTATS_CURRENT_CONFIG is always defined with
# the config value in an AWStats running session and can be used like others.

# Possible values: A full path, or a relative path from awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "/var/log/apache/access.log"
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# You can also use tags in this filename if you need a dynamic file name
# depending on date or time (Replacement is made by AWStats at the beginning
# of its execution). This is available tags :

LogFile="-"
#/home/francis/webstats/publicwhip/logs/access_log"

# Enter here your log format (Must match your web server config. See setup
# instructions in documentation know how to configure your web server to have
# the required log format).
# Possible values: 1,2,3,4,5 or "your_own_personalized_log_format"
# 1 - Apache or Lotus Notes/Domino native combined log format (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format)
# 2 - IIS log format (W3C log format)
# 3 - Webstar native log format
# 4 - Apache or Squid native common log format (NCSA common/CLF log format)
#     With LogFormat=4, some features (browsers, os, keywords...) can't work.
# "your_own_personalized_log_format" = To use AWStats with any not If your log is a personalized format,
#   you must use the following syntax keys to define the log format string:
#   %host             Host client name or IP address
#   %logname          Authenticated login/user used on protected pages
#   %time1            Date and time with format: [dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss +0000]

#   %method           Method with format: GET
#   %url              URL only with format: /index.html
#   %query            Query string (used by URLWithQuery option)
#   %code             Return code status (with format for web log: 999)
#   %bytesd           Size of document in bytes
#   %refererquot      Referer page with format: "http://from.com/from.htm"
#   %referer          Referer page with format: http://from.com/from.htm
#   %uaquot           User agent with format: "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible, ...)"
#   %ua               User agent with format: Mozilla/4.0_(compatible...)
#   %gzipin           mod_gzip compression input bytes: In:XXX
#   %gzipout          mod_gzip compression output bytes & ratio: Out:YYY:ZZZpct.
#   %gzipratio        mod_gzip or mod_deflate compression ratio: ZZZpct.
#   %email            EMail sender (for mail log)
#   %email_r          EMail receiver (for mail log)
#   %syslog           Syslog-specific time and host stamp with format: Mon dd hh:mm:ss hostname
#   %virtualname      Web sever virtual hostname. Use this tag when same log
#                     file contains data of several virtual web servers. The
#                     SiteDomain will be used to filter the one you want.
#   If your log format has some fields not included in this list, use
#   %other            Means another field not used
#
# Examples for Apache combined logs (following two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 1
# LogFormat = "%host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
#
# Examples for IIS (following two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 2
# LogFormat = "%time2 %host %logname %method %url %code %bytesd %other %ua %referer"
#
LogFormat=1


# If your log field's separator is not a space, you can change this parameter.
# This parameter is not used if LogFormat is a predefined value (1,2,3,4,5,6)
# Example: " "
# Example: "\t"
# Example: "|"
# Default: " "
#
LogSeparator=" "


# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name, or the main intranet web
# server name, used to reach the web site.
# If you share the same log file for several virtual web servers, this
# parameter is used to tell AWStats to filter record that contains records for
# this virtual host name only (So check that this virtual hostname can be
# found in your log file and use a personalized log format that include the
# %virtualname tag).
# But for multi hosting a better solution is to have one log file for each
# virtual web server. In this case, this parameter is only used to generate
# full URL's links when ShowLinksOnUrl option is set to 1.
# If analysing mail log, enter here the domain name of mail server.
# Example: "myintranetserver"
# Example: "www.domain.com"
# Example: "ftp.domain.com"
# Example: "domain.com"
#
SiteDomain="www.publicwhip.org.uk"


# Enter here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host
# aliases someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum
# number of possible names/addresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# Use space between each value.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Example: "www.myserver.com x.y.z.w localhost 127.0.0.1"
#
HostAliases="localhost 127.0.0.1"


# If you want to have hosts reported by name instead of ip address, AWStats
# need to make reverse DNS lookups (if not already done in your log file).
# With DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by their IP addresses and
# not by the full hostname of visitors.
# If you want to set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that this will reduce
# dramatically AWStats update process speed. Do not use on large web sites.
# Note: Reverse DNS lookup is done on IPv4 only.
# Note: Country detection can work without reverse DNS lookup if plugin
# 'geoipfree' or 'geoip is enabled (faster and more accurate than reverse DNS
# lookup).
# Possible values:
# 0 - No DNS Lookup
# 1 - DNS Lookup is fully enabled
# 2 - DNS Lookup is made only from static DNS cache file (if exists)
# Default: 2
# 
DNSLookup=1


# When AWStats updates its statistics, it stores results of its analysis in 
# files (AWStats database). All those files are written in the directory
# defined by the "DirData" parameter. Set this value to the directory where
# you want AWStats to save its database and working files into.
# Warning: If you want to be able to use the "AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser"
# feature (see later), you need "Write" permissions by web server user on this
# directory (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Example: "/var/cache/awstats"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_data_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
#DirData="/var/cache/awstats"
DirData="/home/francis/webstats/publicwhip/awstats"

# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats.pl directory.
# This parameter is used only when AWStats is run from command line
# with -output option (to generate links in HTML reported page).
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/mywwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/cgi-bin"


# If AWStats used as a CGI, enter relative or absolute web URL of all icons
# subdirectories.
# If you build static reports ("... -output > outputpath/output.html"), enter
# path of icon directory relative to the directory outputpath.
# Example: "/icon"
# Example: "../icon"
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icon directories in "/mywwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="/awstats-icons"


# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats add a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is ran as a CGI by the web server user defined
# in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX" with
# IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt must be writable by this user. Change permissions if
# necessary to "Read/Write" (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats enough frequently.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is ran from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=0



#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When the update process run, AWStats can set a lock file in TEMP or TMP
# directory. This lock is to avoid to have 2 update processes running at the
# same time to prevent unknown conflicts problems and avoid DoS attacks when
# AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser is set to 1.
# Because, when you use lock file, you can experience sometimes problems in
# lock file not correctly removed (when process is killed for example, this
# requires that you remove the file manualy), this option is not enabled by
# default (Do not enable this option with no consol server access).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
EnableLockForUpdate=0


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a static DNS cache file that was
# previously created manually. If no path is given in static DNS cache file
# name, AWStats will search DirData directory. This file is never changed.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Note: DNS cache file format is 'minsince1970 ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# or just 'ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscache"
# Default: "dnscache.txt"
#
DNSStaticCacheFile="dnscache.txt"


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a DNS cache file that was created
# by a previous run of AWStats. This file is erased and recreated after each
# statistics update process. You don't need to create and/or edit it.
# AWStats will read and save this file in DirData directory.
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: If a DNSStaticCacheFile is available, AWStats will check for DNS
# lookup in DNSLastUpdateCacheFile after checking into DNSStaticCacheFile.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscachelastupdate"
# Default: "dnscachelastupdate.txt"
#
DNSLastUpdateCacheFile="dnscachelastupdate.txt"


# You can specify specific IP addresses that should NOT be looked up in
#  the DNS. You may specify partial addresses (ie 163.85. for everything
#  behind the usual firewall setup, etc)...
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "163.85. 201.101.51.2"
# Default: ""
#
SkipDNSLookupFor=""


# The following two parameters allow you to protect a config file from being
# read by AWStats when called from a browser if web user has not been
# authenticated. Your AWStats program must be in a web protected "realm" (With
# Apache, you can use .htaccess files to do so. With other web servers, see
# your server setup manual).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=0


# This parameter give the list of all authorized authenticated users to view
# statistics for this domain/config file. This parameter is used only if
# AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly is set to 1.
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Example: "user1 user2"
# Example: "__REMOTE_USER__"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers=""


# When this parameter is define to something, the IP address of the user that
# read its statistics from a browser (when AWStats is used as a CGI) is
# checked and must match the IP address range defined by this parameter.
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Example: "123.123.123.10-123.123.123.255"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingIPAddresses=""


# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exists, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it.
# This option can be used by some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a 
# dynamic value for DirData (for example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__") and
# don't want to have to create a new directory each time they add a new user.
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=0


# In most case, AWStats is used as a cgi program. So AWStats process is ran
# by default web server user (nobody for Unix, IUSR_xxx for IIS/Windows,...).
# To make use easier and avoid permission's problems between update process 
# (run by an admin user) and CGI process (ran by a low level user), AWStats
# save its database files with read and write for everyone.
# If you have experience on managing security policies (Web Hosting Provider),
# you should set this parameter to 0. AWStats will keep default process user
# permissions on its files.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 1
#
SaveDatabaseFilesWithPermissionsForEveryone=1


# AWStats can purge log after processing it. By this way, the next time you
# launch AWStats, log file will be smaller and processing time will be better.
# IMPORTANT !!!
# AWStats is able to detect new lines in log file, to process only them, so
# you can launch AWStats as soon as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats update is ran.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=0


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file (saved in "DirData") of
# all processed log records by setting this to 1 (For example if you want to
# use another log analyzer).
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0


# Each time you run the update process, AWStats overwrite the 'historic file'
# for the month (awstatsMMYYYY[.*].txt) with the updated one.
# When write errors occurs (IO, disk full,...), this historic file can be
# corrupted and must be deleted. Because this file contains information of all
# past processed log files, you will loose old stats if removed. So you can
# ask AWStats to save last non corrupted file in a .bak file. This file is
# stored in "DirData" directory with other 'historic files'.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
KeepBackupOfHistoricFiles=0


# Default index page name for your web server.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "default.htm default.html"
# Default: "index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.html"


# Do not include access from clients that match following criteria.
# If your log file contains IP adresses in host field, you must enter here
# matching IP adresses criteria.
# If DNS lookup is already done in your log file, you must enter here hostname
# criteria, else enter ip address criteria.
# The opposite parameter of "SkipHosts" is "OnlyHosts".
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Note: ^xxx means hosts starting with xxx
# Note: xxx$ means hosts ending with xxx

# Note: Use space between each value. This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "konqueror"
# Default: ""
#
SkipUserAgents=""


# Use SkipFiles to ignore access to URLs that match one of following entries.
# You can, with this option, add a list of not important frame pages (like 
# menus, etc...) to exclude them from statistics.
# For example, to ignore a whole directory tree, just add "directorytoignore",
# to ignore "users" pages in your stats, you can add "/~".
# The opposite parameter of "SkipFiles" is "OnlyFiles".
# Note: This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: Use space between each value and do not remove default values.
# Note: ^xxx means url starting with xxx.
# Note: xxx$ means url ending with xxx.

# Default: "robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"
#
SkipFiles="robots.txt$ favicon.ico$"


# Include in stats, only accesses from hosts that match one of following
# entries. For example, if you want AWStats to filter access to keep only

# By default, AWStats considers that records found in web log file are
# successful hits if HTTP code returned by server is a valid HTTP code (200
# and 304). Any other code are reported in HTTP error chart.
# However in some specific environment, with web server HTTP redirection,

# EXTRA SECTION
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns
# keys. This feature is particularly usefull for marketing purpose, tracking
# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note: Each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 8%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section might result in too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionConditionalX are conditions on URL and/or QUERY_STRING and/or
#   REFERER you can use to count or not the hit. Use "|" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a Regex string to tell AWStats how to 
#   extract the value used for first column. Each different value found will
#   be a different row. Be sure that list of different values is "limited" to
#   avoid "not enough memory" problems !
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
#   code letters (P for pages,H for hits,B for bandwidth,L for last access).
# MaxNbOfExtraX is maximum number of rows shown in chart.
# MinHitExtraX is minimum number of hits required to be shown in chart.
#

# Example to report the 20 products the most ordered by "order.cgi" script
#ExtraSectionName1="Product orders"

# Note that when a variable is defined both in a config file and in an
# included file, AWStats will use the last value read.
